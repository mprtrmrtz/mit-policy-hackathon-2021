"Definitions"
"*NR*: Data not reported due to more than 50% of cases with unknown race/ethnicity."
""
"*NA*: Data suppressed when fewer than 10 cases occur."

"Notes"
"Percent of cases in each state may not sum to 100% due to rounding. Percentages are based on a total of all probable and confirmed cases for which race/ethnicity is known. "
""
"% of Cases Missing Race/Ethnicity Data is the share of total cases reported in a state for which race/ethnicity is not known. Some states do not update race/ethnicity information as frequently as the count of total cases for that state, which may increase the % of Cases Missing Race/Ethnicity Data."
